# python-api-challenge
Data Analytics Bootcampe Module 6 Homework assignment.

# Objectives
This activity is broken down into two deliverables, WeatherPy and VacationPy.

## Part 1: WeatherPy
In this deliverable, we create a Python script to visualise the weather of over 500 cities of varying distances from the equator. We use the citipy Python libraryLinks to an external site, the OpenWeatherMap API links to [api.openweathermap.org](http://api.openweathermap.org) to create a representative model of weather across cities.

## Part 2: VacationPy
In this deliverable, we plan future vacations using the output from Part 1. We use Jupyter notebooks, the geoViews Python library, and the [Geoapify API](https://api.geoapify.com) to complete this section.
